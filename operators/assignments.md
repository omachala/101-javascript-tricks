### Assignment operators

> beginner

An assignment operators assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.

For example (addition assignment):

```js
let x = 2;
x += 3; // is equivalent to: x = x + 3;
x; // 5
```

Another examples:

```js
let x;

x = 12;
x *= 2; // 24

x = 12;
x -= 4; // 8

x = 12;
x /= 3; // 4

x = 12;
x %= 5; // 2
```

There are also _shift_ _bitwise_ and _logical_ assignments you can find in [the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#assignment_operators).
